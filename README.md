# Background
This repo contains all codes used for the final year project "Modelling longitudinal trends in human mobility flows during the COVID-19 epidemic in New York State, USA".

The data is given by my supervisor Dr. Oliver Ratmann. It contains the mobility data from 2020-01-30 to 2021-01-05.

# Install
The project used R language and Rstan, if you don't have them. Please install.

# Usage
Files ended up with ".R" can be directly used by opening them in R studio or other editors.

"explore.cellphone.interstate.data.210119.R" contains codes which are used to sample-adjust the original data.

"ea_m4r.R" contains codes used to accomplish the exploratory analysis.
